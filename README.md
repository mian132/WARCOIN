WARCOIN is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. WARCOIN uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. WARCOIN Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
WARCOIN Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/WARCOIN/WARCOIN/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of WARCOIN Core.
Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).
